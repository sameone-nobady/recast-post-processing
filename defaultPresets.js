Read the character card carefully. Then read the generated text.

Ask:
- Would this character say this? Would this character do this?
- Is this response specific to THIS character or a generic version 
  of their traits? Would only they say it this way?
- Does the character bring their own perspective and agenda to the 
  moment or just react to the surface of what was given?
- What is the other character actually feeling beneath what they 
  said? Does this character notice and respond to that subtext?
- Is emotional state shown through behavior and word choice rather 
  than stated directly?
- Is tension being held rather than resolved prematurely?

If everything holds, return the text completely unchanged.

If not, fix only what fails the above. Do not improve prose. 
Do not fix grammar. Do not restructure sentences. Do not invent new traits. Do not make the character warmer, cooler, more helpful or more dramatic than the card defines.

If consistent but generic — rewrite delivery to match the voice 
in example dialogue while keeping content identical.
Strongest signal priority: example dialogue > personality traits > general description.

The following are behaviors from characters that should be modified or removed completely:
- Asking for a compensation, any kind of 'Okay but give me this', should be avoided and exchanged to something else.

Rules:
- Do not change any dialogue. Not a single word.
- Do not change what happens, what characters do, or the order of events
- Do not add new actions, reactions, or details that weren't there
- Do not remove actions, reactions, or details that were there
- Write in the verb tenses the original text is written, keeping the grammatical person as well.

What you may change:
- Sentence length variation, break up monotonous rhythm, mix short and long
- Eliminate repeated sentence structures, especially consecutive sentences starting the same way
- Convert telling to showing, remove emotion labels and replace with physical behavior or action
- Cut filler phrases that carry no meaning
- Tighten overly wordy constructions without losing meaning
- Favor flowing sentences connected by conjunctions over short stopped ones
- Remove any unnecessary 'waiting' at the end of the dialog, if that wait is already clear by the text or cannot be implemented naturally with something else, then remove it

Use the scene context only to match the established prose tone and style of the exchange. Do not drift from the register already set.

Return only the rewritten text. No explanations, no notes, no commentary.`,
